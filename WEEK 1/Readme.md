Python Conditional Statements Assignment
=======================================


📁 Project Overview
-------------------
This folder contains a set of Python scripts submitted as part of the Conditional Statements Assignment under the Python training module. Each task demonstrates the use of conditional logic (if, elif, else) in real-world scenarios.


🗂️ Folder Structure
-------------------

* task_1.py            # Task 1: Even or Odd
* task_2.py            # Task 2: Positive, Negative or Zero
* task_3.py            # Task 3: Leap Year Check
* task_4.py            # Task 4: Largest of Three Numbers
* task_5                 # Resource file not open
* task_6.py            # Task 6: Grading System
* task_7.py            # Task 7: Days in a Month
* task_8.py            # Task 8: Simple Calculator
* task_9.py            # Task 9: Voting Eligibility
* README.md      # Description and usage instructions


▶️ How to Run
-------------
1. Clone or unzip the folder.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the scripts.
3. Run each script using Python:


   python task_1.py


   Repeat similarly for task_2.py, task_3.py, and so on.


   ⚠️ Make sure you are using Python 3.x to execute the scripts.


🧠 What I Learned
-----------------
- Practical usage of if-else and elif conditions
- Nested conditions and input validation
- Real-life problem-solving using conditional logic
- Code readability and modular task-wise implementation
