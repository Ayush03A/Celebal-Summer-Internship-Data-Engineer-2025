# 🌐 Celebal Summer Internship — Data Engineer 2025

Welcome to my internship repository for the **Celebal Summer Internship Program – Data Engineering (2025)**. This repo contains **weekly assignments and real-world data engineering projects** I worked on during my internship at **Celebal Technologies**.

Each week's folder documents a new challenge, tool, or concept — ranging from **SQL and ADF to SFTP, Blob Storage, triggers, and incremental data pipelines**.
