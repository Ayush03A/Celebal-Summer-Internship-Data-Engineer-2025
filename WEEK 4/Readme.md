## 📝 File Naming Convention

To keep everything organized and reviewer-friendly:

- SQL files follow this format: `Task X.sql`  
- Screenshot files follow this format: `Task X.jpg`  
- The number prefix `X` corresponds to the challenge number assigned

> 🔁 **Note:** Task 5 and Task 6 are intentionally identical — both solve the “African Cities” problem:  
> **Query the names of all cities where the CONTINENT is 'Africa'.**

## ✅ How to Review

1. Start with this `README.md` for structure and context  
2. Go to the `SQL_Solutions/` folder to read each SQL query  
3. Refer to the matching screenshot in `Screenshots/` to confirm successful submission on HackerRank
